        <h2>In 2+ sentances describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
        <p>I am at various times a weightlifter, programmer, student, and organizer. I am thus far only compensated for weightlifting and programming. I program at a non-profit health information exchange on the database team. I study many places many times but am currently focusing on this course and the book "The Global Minotaur" by Yanis Varoufakis. I am on sabatical from weightlifting due to old injuries that have re-surfaced.</p>
        <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
        <p>My focus up until now has been to understand data storage and access, but I have always enjoyed making art and sharing information with people. I decided this course was a good first step in forcing me to spend some time on my front-end development skills.</p>
        <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
        <p>I have been taking CS courses from Harvard Extension school since 2013, starting with CS50. I was hired by my employer in the capacity of a programmer about a year ago.</p>
        <h2>What platform are you working on?</h2>
        <p>For this course I will work on a Mac, but at work I work daily on a Windows PC and Linux servers.</p>
        <h2>Is there anything else we should know?</h2>
        <p>If you haven't had time to join the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CodersForSanders">CodersforSanders movement</a> now is better than ever. Voter registration for many Democratic primaries ends in the next month. Let's get out the vote. </p>
